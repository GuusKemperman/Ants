# Welcome to Ants!

This is a work in progress game I am making in my free time. More updates will come, unless I start chasing a new project :)

# Getting started

1. Get the latest version of [Coral Engine - main-lite branch](https://github.com/GuusKemperman/CoralEngine/tree/main-lite).
2. Place the "Ants" directory inside of CoralEngine/Games
3. Open the Ants.sln, select the Ants project to be your startup project.
4. Build and run!
